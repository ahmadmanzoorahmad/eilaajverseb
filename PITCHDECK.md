## 🎯 The Problem

### Healthcare is Broken
- **Data Fragmentation**: Patient records scattered across multiple providers, hospitals, and systems

- **Privacy Concerns**: Centralized data storage creates security vulnerabilities

### The Cost
- $30 billion lost annually to healthcare fraud
- 40% of patients unable to access their complete medical history
- Average of 18 days to verify medical credentials manually
- 1 in 3 patients experience medical errors due to incomplete records
