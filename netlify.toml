# IMPORTANT: Frontend-only static deployment configuration
# See DEPLOYMENT.md for complete deployment guide
#
# This netlify.toml deploys ONLY the frontend to Netlify.
# The Express backend (server/index.js) must be deployed separately.
#
# Quick Setup:
# 1. Deploy backend to Render/Railway/Heroku (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
# 2. Update vite.config.ts proxy or add VITE_API_URL environment variable
# 3. Guest mode works without backend; full features require backend deployment
